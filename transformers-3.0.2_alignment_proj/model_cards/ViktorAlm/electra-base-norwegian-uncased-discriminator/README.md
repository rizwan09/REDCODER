# Norwegian Electra
![Image of norwegian electra](https://i.imgur.com/QqSEC5I.png)

Trained on Oscar + wikipedia + opensubtitles + some other data I had with the awesome power of TPUs(V3-8)

Use with caution. I have no downstream tasks in Norwegian to test on so I have no idea of its performance yet.

## Electra: Pre-training Text Encoders as Discriminators Rather Than Generators
