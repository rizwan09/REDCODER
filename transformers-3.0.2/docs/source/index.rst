Transformers
================================================================================================================================================

State-of-the-art Natural Language Processing for Pytorch and TensorFlow 2.0.

ü§ó Transformers (formerly known as `pytorch-transformers` and `pytorch-pretrained-bert`) provides general-purpose 
architectures (BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, XLM, DistilBert, XLNet...) for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural 
Language Generation (NLG) with over 32+ pretrained models in 100+ languages and deep interoperability between 
TensorFlow 2.0 and PyTorch.

This is the documentation of our repository `transformers <https://github.com/huggingface/transformers>`_.

Features
---------------------------------------------------

- High performance on NLU and NLG tasks
- Low barrier to entry for educators and practitioners

State-of-the-art NLP for everyone:

- Deep learning researchers
- Hands-on practitioners
- AI/ML/NLP teachers and educators

Lower compute costs, smaller carbon footprint:

- Researchers can share trained models instead of always retraining
- Practitioners can reduce compute time and production costs
- 8 architectures with over 30 pretrained models, some in more than 100 languages

Choose the right framework for every part of a model's lifetime:

- Train state-of-the-art models in 3 lines of code
- Deep interoperability between TensorFlow 2.0 and PyTorch models
- Move a single model between TF2.0/PyTorch frameworks at will
- Seamlessly pick the right framework for training, evaluation, production

Contents
---------------------------------

The documentation is organized in five parts:

- **GET STARTED** contains a quick tour, the installation instructions and some useful information about our philosophy
  and a glossary.
- **USING ü§ó TRANSFORMERS** contains general tutorials on how to use the library.
- **ADVANCED GUIDES** contains more advanced guides that are more specific to a given script or part of the library.
- **RESEARCH** focuses on tutorials that have less to do with how to use the library but more about general resarch in
  transformers model
- **PACKAGE REFERENCE** contains the documentation of each public class and function.

The library currently contains PyTorch and Tensorflow implementations, pre-trained model weights, usage scripts and
conversion utilities for the following models:
