# ü§ó + üìö dbmdz Turkish ELECTRA model

In this repository the MDZ Digital Library team (dbmdz) at the Bavarian State
Library open sources a cased ELECTRA small model for Turkish üéâ

# Turkish ELECTRA model

We release a small ELEC**TR**A model for Turkish, that was trained on the same data as *BERTurk*.

> ELECTRA is a new method for self-supervised language representation learning. It can be used to
> pre-train transformer networks using relatively little compute. ELECTRA models are trained to
> distinguish "real" input tokens vs "fake" input tokens generated by another neural network, similar to
> the discriminator of a GAN.

More details about ELECTRA can be found in the [ICLR paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1xMH1BtvB)
or in the [official ELECTRA repository](https://github.com/google-research/electra) on GitHub.

## Stats

The current version of the model is trained on a filtered and sentence
segmented version of the Turkish [OSCAR corpus](https://traces1.inria.fr/oscar/),
a recent Wikipedia dump, various [OPUS corpora](http://opus.nlpl.eu/) and a
special corpus provided by [Kemal Oflazer](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/ko/).

The final training corpus has a size of 35GB and 44,04,976,662 tokens.

Thanks to Google's TensorFlow Research Cloud (TFRC) we could train a cased model
on a TPU v3-8 for 1M steps.

## Model weights

[Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
compatible weights for both PyTorch and TensorFlow are available.

## Usage

With Transformers >= 2.8 our ELECTRA small cased model can be loaded like:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelWithLMHead, AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("dbmdz/electra-small-turkish-cased-discriminator")
model = AutoModelWithLMHead.from_pretrained("dbmdz/electra-small-turkish-cased-discriminator")
```
