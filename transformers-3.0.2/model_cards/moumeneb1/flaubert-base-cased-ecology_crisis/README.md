# Flaubert-base-cased-ecology_crisis

An adapted [__Flaubert/Flaubert_base-cased model__](https://github.com/getalp/Flaubert) Trained further on a Language modeling Task of unlabeled French tweets used to create the [CrisisDataset](https://github.com/DiegoKoz/french_ecological_crisis), The intermediate task of masqued language modeling helped us improve the results on our [paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306457320300650) compared to the standard flaubert-base-cased model.
